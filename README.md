# ipfsmap
Tile server system based on IPFS

This is a small project that unifies openstreetmap.org along with ipfs

The aim is to create a free X/Y/Z tile system for developers who are creating map featured apps.

Resources for this pourpose are heavy in data storage and transmission. Now they can be soften.

The ideal scenario would be that in which you wouldn't have to worry much about the underlying tile system and put your efforts in making your business model work.

The strength of IPFS is in static content storage and transmission, very helpful indeed, let's make use of it.

to be continued :) ...

For now, you can try a live demo here: http://pulsartronic.duckdns.org/ donâ€™t expect speed, specially if it is the first time your region is accessed. Gateway list is short and sometimes they fail.
It basically access links like this one http://pulsartronic.duckdns.org/tile.php?z=7&x=66&y=46 for every tile it needs.
